This means I can get the job done efficiently and effectively.\nOne of Michelle's Vocal Coaches is Melissa Disney (Gone In 60 Seconds Trailer, Voice of Snow White, Announcer of the Emmy's and Grammy's)\n\nShe also works with the extraordinary vocal talent and coach J. Michael Collins.\n\nVoice Over Classes:\nPatrick Fraley\nMarc Graue\nVOMastery\n\nProfessional Singer for over 20 years\n\nJingles:\nHola Fruta\nCoca-Cola\nMusic Recordings:\nHarmonies for Kenny Rogers, Jim Brickman, SAM, Tommy Walker, Cloverdayle,  Savannah Outen, Blessid Union of Soul\nBock iFet, Neumann U87, Sennheiser MKH-416, BAE 1073 MPF, Chandlr R.E.D.D.47, Avid OMNI with Black Lion XB Mod, ProTools 12 HD, ATC SCM 25a Pro Monitoring, Audioquest cabling throughout.\n\nCan send files via Email, Dropbox, FTP and WeTransfer.\nI try to find the \"heart\" of every script.  I have a passion for words, people and for the planet's beauty.  If there is something I haven't heard of, I find it thrilling to research it and expand my knowledge of an upcoming technology or perhaps a new app or see the good that a company does with the proceeds of their Charity Events or Giving Galas.  \n\nI have been involved in church outreach teams that took me to Brazil and then Macedonia for months.  I have led a team to raise funds of over $7,000 within a few weeks to help out a Cure for Cancer.  I trained for and participated in the 2008 Los Angeles Marathon.  I loved the challenge from not even being able to run a mile, to accomplishing such a feat.   \n\nThese are just some of my life experiences, but I believe they have made me \"feel\" the copy that I read.  My ultimate goal is to always give a genuine delivery, but also take note of what the client and writer of the script has in mind.  \nI love what I do and would love to work with you!  ~Michelle Sundholm",
